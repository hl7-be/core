Description: """This is a supporting profile, only to give guidelines how to express a few of the typical coding systems.
In general, it shall be noted SNOMED-CT is the preferred national terminology. Other coding systems remain allowed or MAY be preferred in specific flows (e.g. the use of LOINC codes to express a laboratory test.)"""
